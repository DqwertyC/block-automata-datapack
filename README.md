# Block Automata
Simulates several block automata in minecraft.

To get started, fill a large, flat area with light gray concrete. Run the command:  

    /function block_automata:ui/give_seeds  

to get a set of starters for different automata. Automata rules can be modified by changing the list of ints stored in the item's nbt.

Once the area is prepared, place yellow conrete to set living cells, and yellow wool to set undying/source living cells. 
Gray concrete and wool are dead cells. Run the command  

    /function block_automata:ui/give_controls
    
to get a set of control potions to start and stop the simulation, as well as step through it one tick at a time or change simulation speed.
